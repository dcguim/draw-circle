Task:
  - Write a program in python that takes the following inputs and then outputs
  an image of a black circle on a white background in png.

Inputs:
  - Radius of the circle in pixel: r
  - Thickness of the circle in pixel: d
  - Center of the circle in pixel coordinate: x, y
  - Size of the image in pixel: h, w

Outputs:
  - circle.png

Additional considerations:
  - The input will be given such that the circle is fully contained in the
    image.
  - Simple console input / output is sufficient.

Hint:
  - Feel free to use external libraries to do everything else except for the
    function to draw the circle.
  - It goes without saying that we are looking beyond simply just a correct
    solution.

Deliverables:
  - Provide the solution in a package that can used / executed by a non-IT
    personel.
  - Provide comments on the space / time complexity of the function used to
    draw the circle.

Evaluation:
  - quality of code
  - breath and depth of the knowledge in programming concepts
  - accessibility / maintainability of solution
